# Fizzy

## Setting up for development

First get everything installed and configured with:

    bin/setup

If you'd like to load fixtures:

    bin/rails db:fixtures:load

And then run the development server:

    bin/dev

You'll be able to access the app in development at http://development-tenant.fizzy.localhost:3006


## Deploying

Fizzy is deployed with Kamal. You'll need to have the 1Password CLI set up in order to access the secrets that are used when deploying. Provided you have that, it should be as simple as `bin/kamal deploy` to the correct environment.

For beta:

    bin/kamal deploy -d beta

And for production:

    bin/kamal deploy -d production
